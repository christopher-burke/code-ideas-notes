# Problem Solving Methodology #

In one form or another, you will have been given a description of the requirements for a program. Read the description first to get a general idea of the scope of the problem. Read it a second time being careful to understand what the actual problem is - quite often the problem statement is hidden by lots of other information.

Ask Questions! Use this as the first and most important step in the problem definition phase. For projects, perform the remaining four steps (2 - 5) of the problem solving method.


1. Ask lots of questions.
  * Ask yourself how you would do it manually.
  * Identify tasks you cannot do or do not understand.
  * Ask more questions.


2. Identify processes and procedures from a flow chart or other analysis tools.
  * Sketch a rough layout for a user interface. Make sure that it includes all pertinent inputs, outputs and controls.
  * Take a step back and describe the major steps that are to be performed.
  * Use divide and conquer. Describe major functions and then break them down into smaller and smaller functions until you are satisfied that you cannot divide them any further.
  * Once a function is defined, you should concern yourself with what it does rather than how it does it. The question of how need only be addressed when you implement the function itself.


 3. Identify the inputs and outputs and their data types.
  * Inputs and outputs to the program.
  * Inputs and outputs from major processes and procedures.
  * Draw an Input-Process-Output (data flow) diagram for each major process and procedure.


4. Define the math and logic processing.
  * Formulae, algorithms, flow charts, etc.
  * Concern yourself with how a function works.


5. Implement the solution.
  * Make sure that you meet all of the requirements set forth.
  * Test the solution. For sample data, verify that it produces the correct result.
  * Don't let frustration overwhelm you. It is quite common for minor logic and syntactical errors to produce utterly useless programs.


Note steps 2 and 3 are not unrelated. Sometimes, it is more convenient to identify inputs and outputs and then perform step 2 to identify processes and procedures.
